# Welcome to SimpleKotlinMail

SimpleKotlinMail is a Kotlin Email API - coroutine based, easy to use and modern!
You can use it for both clientside and serverside projects, meaning you can **send** and **receive** emails.

### Coroutines

Send emails without blocking the current thread.

### Easy to use

Create emails, mailers and SMTP servers with the help of intuitive Kotlin builders.

### Modern

SimpleKotlinMail hides unnecessary and overly complicated parts of the mail protocol from you.
Additionally, the API is typesafe.

## Get Started
