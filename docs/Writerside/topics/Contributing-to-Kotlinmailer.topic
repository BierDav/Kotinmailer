            requests</a>:
            <list type="decimal">
                <li>Fork the Kotlinmailer repository because imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.</li>
                <li>Clone your fork to your local machine.</li>
                <li>Create a new branch for your changes.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/BierDav/Kotlinmailer/compare">Create</a> a new PR with a request to
                    merge to the
                    **master** branch.
                </li>
                <li>Ensure that the description is clear and refers to an existing ticket/bug if applicable</li>
                <li>When contributing a new feature, provide motivation and use-cases describing why the feature not
                    only provides value to Exposed, but also why it would make sense to be part of the
                    Exposed framework itself.
                </li>
                <li>If the contribution requires updates to documentation (be it updating existing contents or creating
                    a new one), file a new ticket on <a href="https://github.com/BierDav/Kotlinmailer/issues">GitHub</a>.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure any code contributed is covered by tests and no existing tests are broken. We use Docker
                    containers to run tests.
                </li>
                <li>Execute the `detekt` task in Gradle to perform code style validation.</li>
                <li>Finally, make sure to run the `apiCheck` Gradle task. If it is not successful, run the `apiDump`
                    Gradle task.
